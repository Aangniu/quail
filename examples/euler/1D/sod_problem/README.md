This case involves the well-known Sod problem configuration.
The Sod problem is a specific type of Riemann problem.  
  - Left and right states are defined as follows:
    - `uL = [1., 0., 1.]` and `uR = [0., .1, .5]` 
    (`rho, u, p` respectively)
  - Post-processing plots the exact solution against the 
  pressure and density.
